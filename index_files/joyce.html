<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those sending mail to Joyce, please continue to use her LaClaire Ave address for mail. It will be picked</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">up and brought over to her at her temporary residence. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joyce’s old house phone number is now back in service. It rings through to her new temporary residence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3/5</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The new address for the most visited patient at Genesis Rehab is 5910 Oak Twin Ct, Apt C, Linthicum, MD 21090. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She will continue to receive home health care and therapy at this temporary residence.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3/2</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the progress she has made, Joyce has been now moved from the rehab facility. Her new location is in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Linthicum. The phone should be hooked up later this week.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1/31</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sorry to report, Crumpet passed away yesterday in her sleep. She was 14. Her caregivers shared the news with Joyce.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s now been 6 weeks since all this started.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A note regarding Joyce’s care:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While at BayView, and particularly while her heart medications were getting stabilized, Joyce was in intensive care.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When her meds were stabilized and her breathing tube was removed so she could speak, her care level was lowered</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">but she remained in the ICU area to maintain a consistency of medical care and limit opportunities for infection. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">number of visits from nursing staff members dropped but they were always right outside her door, literally.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At Genesis, the ratio of staff to patients is significantly lower than it was in the ICU. She is being visited regularly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">during rounds (during one two-hour period we counted 7 different staffers coming through) but on the weekends the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">staffing is noticeably lighter. If you are visiting and you see that she has unmet needs due to the staff/patient ratio,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">please intervene on her behalf. The nursing station for hall B is right down the hall from her but in her condition she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">can neither reach it physically or be heard there. For a while we will be her legs and voice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, if you become aware of medical issues you feel are not being addressed, please let the medical staff know.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thanks.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By popular demand, here are post-fire photos of Crumpet.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Word is there are lots of visits going on over at Hammonds Lane. That’s great, and it’s all helping her along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
Joyce’s room phone number appears to be 410-350-8614 if you’d like to call ahead of visiting.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1/22</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I visited with Joyce today at Genesis, as did multiple people from St Philip Neri. And among the visitors today was one on four</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">legs, Crumpet - their first reunion since the day of the fire. Thanks to Stephanie and her family for caring for her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">and for bringing her by today.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joyce’s stay at Genesis Rehab (Room 4-B, 613 Hammonds Lane, 410-636-3400 is the main desk phone number) will</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">be focused on her physical therapy to recover full function of her hands. Her upper body burn wounds are continuing to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">heal. Today was the first day I’d seen her left hand uncovered, and she is working it to develop dexterity and strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her voice is stronger every day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thank you to all who keep her going; she will need your continued support as she goes through the physical therapy</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">work there. Please keep the cards and visits coming. The phone number above is the main desk; she does not have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">a number in her room (which is a shared room) at this time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1/19</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With progress in eating, Joyce has undergone medical reviews and further rehab. As of this afternoon (1/19) she will</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">be relocating to Genesis Hammonds Lane Center, in Brooklyn Park near Linthicum, close to the house and SPN.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She will return to Bayview for evaluations as needed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The address there is 613 Hammonds Lane.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Their phone is 410-636-3400.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1/12</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joyce had multiple visitors today (from Seton, JASNA, and church) and several yesterday as well. These visits are</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">helping keep her spirits up, as she is pretty limited in what she can do right now. Thanks to everyone who is able to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">drop a card in the mail or get time to be with her.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most of the injuries to her upper body are healing very well, so the scope of the remaining bandaged areas is fairly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">small. Her hands are still healing from the graft surgery last week, and that will be the area of greatest continual focus</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">over the next bit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
1/8</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Saw Joyce this morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First, a request: while her voice is stronger, she can’t have phone calls right now for a couple of reasons. Post-</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">surgery she is incapable of holding the phone so the only way the phone call works is if an ICU nurse is standing there</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">holding the phone for her. If you are distant, she would prefer cards at this time; we’ll have them brought and read to</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">her. Just send cards to the house address.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She is still recovering from the graft surgery to both arms, and does not have the use of either hand right now as</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">they heal. She is making strong continued progress with the upper body (the body is an amazing thing when we</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">give it a chance to heal and care for it so well). She still is partially intubated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tomorrow marks 3 weeks since the incident that started all this. Thanks to everyone who has reached out and to all</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">who have visited with her and lifted prayers for her.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1/4</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joyce had surgery today for the injuries on her arms. She will continue to recover at BayView. Thanks to all who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">have sent cards - a stack of them was taken to the hospital this week to share with her.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given her surgery, please call ahead when visiting, especially on 1/5.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1/2</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joyce is continuing to make strong progress. Her speech is still very soft and that is an area she is working on, so she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">is still not able to speak on the phone. She is still physically located in the ICU but is no longer under intensive</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">care due to the progress she has made. Determinations on future care for her hands and arms is still a week or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">two away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She is available for visits, as outlined previously. Please call ahead, as the care and diagnostic procedures may result</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">in you waiting in the lounge for 1-2 hours if timed incorrectly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12/29</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If anyone visits and security gives you an issue regarding the now-defunct restricted list, have the security personnel</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">call up to the Burn ICU charge nurse and that nursing station will inform the security staff of the proper status.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Evidently the change in status does not make it down to all of the entrance points of the hospital in a consistent</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">fashion. We have always parked in the open air lot near emergency and entered where it says “West Entrance” and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">have had no issues when entering there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When visiting, there is a visitors lounge on the 3rd floor outside the Red elevators. Use the phone in there to dial</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">the nursing station in the ICU (00890) and verify the visit time is okay, and they will tell you to come back down the hall.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s also a coffee machine there but I strongly advise using the one in the cafeteria on the 1st floor instead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joyce is having regular visitors now, including those who read Jane Austen to her, and she is grateful for the visits.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her health continues to improve and the change over the course of 10 days is pretty remarkable. Speaking is still</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">a difficulty so I expect phone calls will be delayed a while longer. The upper body areas are healing and the attention</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">will focus to her hands and their recovery. She has a radio that can play CDs. Her vision is still blurry from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">medications related to the facial treatments so she cannot read or watch movies/TV at this time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12/27</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The official word from the Charge Nurse: As Joyce can speak now without impacting her health, she can have any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">visitor of her choosing and the prior restriction list is no longer in effect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From personal experience, the best times to visit are 10-noon and then after 2:30 pm in order to avoid conflicting</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">with doctors’ rounds and nursing procedures. As she progresses and the patterns change (for example, to include<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">physical therapy) those hours may change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’d recommend calling an hour or so prior to visiting. The nursing station within the Burn ICU is 410-550-0890. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">cannot give out any medical information; but if you ask if Joyce would be available for visitors during a certain time</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">window, they can ask her attending nurses and provide their best guess. Their focus will be on her physical health</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">and they may alter her availability based on her progress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12/27</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As you are reading this, you are in good company with people from across the country. This includes family members,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jane Austen Society members, former neighbors, high school classmates, former coworkers, and more. It should not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">surprise you that Joyce has kept in close touch with all of these, and that all of them treasure her. To quote one from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">yesterday: “Even though we meet only once a year she is my dearest friend.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many have asked about providing support for Joyce and Crumpet. Her ongoing care needs after she is discharged</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">are not yet known. She will be going through rehab for her hands, and I don’t know what additional care or expenses will</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">be associated with that. Crumpet is presently living in the home of a compassionate and highly capable friend and is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">receiving 24 hour care; I don’t have insight into the long-term plan there either yet. In any case, anything sent to Joyce’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">home address is being collected and will be processed appropriately.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Joyce is now able to speak on her own, she is more able to have visitors. She is still in the ICU so visits are still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">limited by the staff as it is a work site first and foremost. No minors are permitted, and the staff will intervene if she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">becomes emotional during a visit (as they monitor her vital signs as part of her recovery) so it is important to be a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">calming and supportive presence. Check ahead to see if she is available for visitors, as the procedures she goes through</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">for care can take hours.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Work on the house cleanup will begin this week, led by the insurance company representatives and overseen by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trish and Adam on behalf of Joyce. The cleanup has to happen before the rebuild/reconstruction can begin.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last night around 9:30 pm marked the one week mark since all this started. Thanks to everyone who got us through</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">this week.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12/25</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Merry Christmas! Joyce is speaking now, softly as she recovers from the days with the breathing tube. She is working</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">to regain her strength and conditioning as she faces the rehabilitation steps ahead and as she continues to</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">heal from the wounds. She has certainly regained her sense of humor and is facing the situation with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">character you would expect. She is still @Bay View. There is not an exact path forward or timeline set yet;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">that all depends on her progress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12/24</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Very limited visitation today as the medical professionals do their work. The good news is I’ve been told by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">medical staff that the main breathing supplement tube has been removed, which I’m sure will reduce her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">discomfort and improve communications. It’s also a good sign that the inhaled smoke must be clearing well and</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">she is breathing on her own. Things are moving in the right direction.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Took another picture of Crumpet in to show her. She does not have place in the ICU for cards and letters; if you’d<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">like to send a card please send it to the house and it will be shared with her when we can get to that point.<br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12/23</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Today saw multiple visits: me and Sue in the morning, followed by her priest and a parishioner in the afternoon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">at her request.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The good news is that this morning we improved the communications so she can express herself to us via letters</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">selected from a page of letters (it felt like the scene from The Martian where they put the letters out in a circle).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This has allowed her to share questions on a variety of topics and we have been able to engage the right staff<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">to address them quickly. Sometimes even a small thing, like being able to ask for a comb, can have an impact.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She is aware of the status of her pets. Thank you to everyone who continues to care for Crumpet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She continues to need tubes to help remove what she inhaled, and that will keep her in the ICU. She is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">receiving exceptional care. She doesn’t have a place for cards or flowers still given the nature of an ICU. Cards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">sent to her home address will be retained for when we can share them with her.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thanks to all for their prayers and their continued support. I can’t tell you the number of people who have told me</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">she is their favorite person or closest friend. What a gift she is.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12/22</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thanks to everyone for their continued outreach and concern. Joyce continues to make progress and is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">communicating more. She is being visited every day, and her ability to interact is improving greatly. I am hopeful</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">that she will be extubated shortly and then moved out of the ICU, at which point visitation schedules<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We continue to be focused on the outcomes, and the progress in just these short few days toward those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">outcomes is really striking. The staff and support teams at the hospital are impressive at all hours of the day</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thanks to Trish and Adam, work has begun with the insurance company on the house. Thanks to everyone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">who is providing material help there as they begin this next stage, which will likely be a months-long effort to</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Message from Terry F:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A group will be gathering on Friday at 2:00 in the St Philip Neri Chapel to pray for Joyce.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12/21</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wednesday’s update:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joyce continues to make strong progress. Thus far all indications regarding her injuries have been showing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">improvement, and we are optimistic that will continue. She is receiving excellent care.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To support that care and her progress, the visits to her bedside are now restricted. She is still in an ICU and it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">in the best interest of her health to defer meetings until she can participate fully. The doctors and nurses working</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">there appreciate our support in this. Any questions, let me know.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along the same lines, the nursing staff is not authorized to give patient health updates over the phone. We need to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">let them focus on doing their job, and I hope that these updates cover what’s needed. I’m not going to go into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">patient details beyond what is posted here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given that people are looking for something physical to do, and can’t share flowers or cards now, or visit, or take</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">her a casserole, what are the options?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Knowing Joyce, you know that any prayer said on her behalf would be welcome, in any language.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And if you are familiar with the situation, you know there are people who helped her that night - a neighbor who helped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">her that night, and people who spent the night lining up care and others who have spent the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">last 36 hours acting on her behalf to ensure her continued care. Treat those folks nicely, they’re being God’s hands in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">12/20</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To reach Joyce’s many friends, Trish and I will be providing this consolidated update on a regular basis. It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">difficult to keep everyone up to date and in sync, so please check here first for any updates.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joyce is still at the hospital, and it is not advisable to visit her at this time. Please give us another 24 to 36 hours<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">to see how her situation stabilizes. While I realize everyone would like to spend time there, please realize due<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">to her present condition she cannot fully participate in those meetings and that leads to increased agitation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">levels. Along with her care providers we are focusing on providing her the best chance to recover and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">recuperate and hope that a controlled set of visitors provides that. Thank you for bearing with us.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along those same lines, please hold off on flowers. The unit she is in is specifically isolated to minimize outside</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">sources of potential infection. In the same situations, she would be offering prayers and support and I think that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">is really the best approach most of us can offer at this time. There will be opportunities in the days to come to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">more fully engage with her recovery, and we will keep you apprised of this progress.</span></p>
